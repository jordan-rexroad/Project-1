# Project-1


My name is Jordan Rexroad

Overview/Description

My project is a Portfolio for myself. I introduce myself to the user in the header tag as a web developer based in Fort Worth, TX. The user will then see at the bottom of the page the words "Passionate about making your site a beautiful site to see." Below that sentence is a button that says "Learn more". If the user clicks on "Learn more" they will be taken to my Portfolio page. If the user doesn't click on "Learn more" they can scroll down to read my "About me". If the user decides that they want to see more information they can scroll up to the dropdown menu bar and click on either "Portfolio" or "Contact". If the user clicks on "Portfolio" they will then be taken to the Portfolio page. The user will see the word "Portfolio" over an image of a file. Under the file will be the words "My favorite way to explain my passion is to share it. Enjoy!". The user can scroll down and click on Project 1, Project 2, or Project 3. Project 1 will take the user to a project of mine and Project 2 and 3 will take the user to two other projects of mine. If a user clicks on "Contact" in the navigation bar they will be taken to the Contact page. The contact page will say at the top "Have any questions? Want to team up? Contact me here!" The Contact page has a contact form ready to be filled out and submitted. Once the user has submitted their form they can scroll back to the top and click on the "Home" button in the dropdown menu bar and be taken back to the Home Page. 

Technology used 

I used Html and CSS


Future Improvements

1.) I would like to have better projects to place in the Project 1 2 and 3 folders.
2.) I would like to improve my display of the about page.
3.) I would like to add more design to the contact form.
